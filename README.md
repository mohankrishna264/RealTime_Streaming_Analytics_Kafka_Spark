Sales Forecasting for Large Retail Chains: A Data Science Approach
Welcome to the Sales Forecasting for Large Retail Chains Project! This project leverages Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict retail sales based on product attributes and store features. It helps retailers optimize pricing, marketing strategies, and inventory management by predicting future sales trends.

Project Overview
Have you ever wondered how factors like product visibility, pricing, and store type impact sales in large retail chains? This project answers those questions by analyzing real-world retail data. We employ advanced machine learning models to predict sales, enabling better business decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency.

With the help of cutting-edge techniques, we explore retail sales trends and provide actionable insights that can help businesses stay competitive in the market.

Key Features
üßπ Data Preprocessing
We clean and transform the dataset, ensuring it's ready for model training and evaluation. Missing data is handled appropriately, and features are engineered to improve prediction performance.

üìà Data Visualization
This project includes visualizations that help you explore how features like product visibility, pricing, and store type influence sales.

ü§ñ Machine Learning Models
We utilize a variety of advanced machine learning models to predict retail sales accurately. Some of the models include:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
These models are trained to predict sales based on the provided dataset, giving businesses accurate forecasts.

üìä Model Evaluation
We evaluate our models using several performance metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R-squared (R¬≤)
These metrics ensure that our models provide precise predictions and are optimized for performance.
